## Gapfilled precipitation at the NPP study sites 

1. Gap-filled daily precipitation at the 15 long-term NPP sites at Jornada Basin LTER, 1980-ongoing

Yao, J., H. Savoy, J. Anderson, and D. Peters. 2023. Gap-filled daily precipitation at the 15 long-term NPP sites at Jornada Basin LTER, 1980-ongoing ver 76. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/7f458fb6fd3280f8a75c9e0ad221a037 (Accessed 2023-03-07).

This package contains gap-filled daily precipitation values for the 15 NPP sites at Jornada Basin LTER in southern New Mexico, USA. Sites were selected to represent the 5 major ecosystem types in the Chihuahuan Desert (upland grasslands, playa grasslands, mesquite-dominated shrublands, creosotebush-dominated shrublands, tarbush-dominated shrublands). For each ecosystem type, three sites were selected to represent the range in variability in production and plant diversity; thus the locations are not replicates. Gap-filled daily precipitation was calculated for the period from 1980 to 2020 at each site using the closest rain gauges that provided a minimum resolution of daily precipitation data. The Methods section and attached documents describe this process in detail. The rain gauges used are described, with respect to their relationship to NPP sites, in the attached "daily_gapfill_ppt_gauge_usage.csv" file. Although automated weather stations became operational at all NPP sites in 2013 (except P-SMAL, in 2017), updates to this data package are ongoing and are intended to gap-fill any missing or invalid data from the weather stations. 



## Vegetation

### Net Primary Production (NPP)
1. Annual mean estimates of aboveground net primary production (NPP) at 15 sites at Jornada Basin LTER, 1989-ongoing

Peters, D. and L. Huenneke. 2022. Annual mean estimates of aboveground net primary production (NPP) at 15 sites at Jornada Basin LTER, 1989-ongoing ver 105. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/925c86b094c123fae4ddabf31cf92a30 (Accessed 2023-03-07).

 This package contains values of mean annual aboveground net primary production (NPP, in grams per square meter per year) at 15 NPP study sites on Jornada Experimental Range (JER) and Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) lands. Sites were selected to represent the 5 major ecosystem types in the Chihuahuan Desert (upland grasslands, playa grasslands, mesquite-dominated shrublands, creosotebush-dominated shrublands, tarbush-dominated shrublands). For each ecosystem type, three sites were selected to represent the range in variability in production and plant diversity; thus the locations are not replicates. At each site, a 1 hectare area was fenced in 1988 and a grid of 49 (48 at one playa location) 1m x 1m replicate quadrats was laid out when sampling began in 1989. In fall, winter, and spring periods aboveground biomass was calculated for each species and quadrat at each NPP site. These calculations rely on two data sources: 1) non-destructive horizontal cover and vertical height measurements of individual plants, or plant parts, within each quadrat, and 2) linear regression coefficients for each plant species derived from off-quadrat cover, height, and harvested biomass measurements. NPP is then calculated as the positive biomass increment between seasons. The annual totals in this dataset are derived by summing mean site NPP values for winter (October - February), spring (February - May), and fall (May - October) increments for a single calendar year. Data collection is ongoing with new annual NPP values calculated after the conclusion of each growing season.

Attention:

1) Calculated values in this data package have changed over time as the methodology for estimating biomass has changed. 2) Relating long-term NPP in this package with long-term precipitation is problematic given the importance of wet and dry periods and their effect on production in these ecosystems. 3) Data from 2013 and later are currently in provisional status and subject to change as we review the allometric equations used for estimating biomass.


2. Seasonal aboveground plant biomass estimates at 15 net primary production (NPP) study sites at Jornada Basin LTER from 1989-ongoing

Peters, D. and L. Huenneke. 2022. Seasonal aboveground plant biomass estimates at 15 net primary production (NPP) study sites at Jornada Basin LTER from 1989-ongoing ver 2. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/26ca2b57d068e8f866aeedfa581a6e6b (Accessed 2023-03-07).

 This data package contains aboveground vegetation cover, volume, and calculated biomass values at the 15 Net Primary Production (NPP) study sites on Jornada Experimental Range (JER) and Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) lands. Sites were selected to represent the 5 major ecosystem types in the Chihuahuan Desert (upland grasslands, playa grasslands, mesquite-dominated shrublands, creosotebush-dominated shrublands, tarbush-dominated shrublands). For each ecosystem type, three sites were selected to represent the range in variability in production and plant diversity; thus the locations are not replicates. At each site, a 1 hectare area was fenced in 1988 and a grid of 49 (48 at one playa location) 1m x 1m replicate quadrats was laid out when sampling began in 1989. For each quadrat, aboveground biomass has been calculated from two data sources: 1) non-destructive horizontal cover and vertical height measurements of individual plants, or plant parts, within each quadrat, and 2) linear regression coefficients for each plant species derived from off-quadrat cover, height, and harvested biomass measurements. Non-destructive measurements (1) are taken during winter, spring, and fall measurement campaigns, then aggregated by species for each quadrat, and resulting dimensions are used to calculate species biomass (grams) by quadrat and season using using the species-specific regression coefficients derived from dataset 2. This is the most detailed biomass dataset available and can be used to derive values of net primary production between seasons or annually. Each dataset record contains calculated biomass (and related variables) by species, quadrat, season, and site. Data collection is ongoing with new observations in spring, fall, and winter of each year, but this data package may be updated less frequently.

Attention:

1) For most species, these data are not appropriate for estimates of percentage cover because of the way the data are collected. 2) Calculated values in this data package have changed over time as the methodology for estimating biomass has changed. 3) Relating long-term NPP derived from this package with long-term precipitation is problematic given the importance of wet and dry periods and their effect on production in these ecosystems. 4) Data from 2013 and later are currently in provisional status and subject to change as we review the allometric equations used for estimating biomass.

### Line Point Intercept

1.  Percent cover of vegetation measured by the line-intercept method at multiple locations on long-term ecosystem transects (including nitrogen fertilization treatments) at Jornada Basin LTER, 1982-2014

Cunningham, G. 2019. Percent cover of vegetation measured by the line-intercept method at multiple locations on long-term ecosystem transects (including nitrogen fertilization treatments) at Jornada Basin LTER, 1982-2014 ver 128. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/08a04ff1aa1c822205dee396a0c28981 (Accessed 2023-03-07).

This data package contains data on the average percent cover of plant species on three permanent LTER-I transects at the Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) in southern New Mexico. Prior to becoming a livestock exclosure, the study site was moderately to heavily grazed for the past 100 years. The purpose of this study was to document the vegetation changes associated with the addition of nitrogen fertilizer following nearly a century of grazing. Three permanent, parallel transects (2.7 km in length) run from the middle of the College Playa up to the foot of Mt. Summerford. The Treatment transect was treated annually with ammonium nitrate fertilizer (NH4NO3 at 10g N/m2/yr) until 1987. Along each transect, 91 stations, each with a plant intercept line, are spaced at 30 meter intervals. Each plant intercept line is perpendicular to a 2.7 km transect and is 30 meters in length broken into 5 meter segments. The included dataset gives calculated average percent cover of each plant species for each of these plant intercept lines on all three LTER-I permanent transects (91 lines each). Measurements were made biannually from 1982 - 1988. After this, they are measured every 5 years. Data consists of the date, week number, transect, station number, JRN species code, USDA Plants code, species binomial, photosynthetic pathway, habit, form, and average percent cover. This study is ongoing. 

### Plant Cover Permanent Quad Locations

1. Plant Cover at Permanent Quad Locations on the Jornada Experimental Range, 1915-ongoing

Chapline, W., K. Havstad, and B. Bestelmeyer. 2020. Plant Cover at Permanent Quad Locations on the Jornada Experimental Range, 1915-ongoing ver 49. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/63bfa45df4858db674bf37b52ee5ff44 (Accessed 2023-03-07)

This ongoing data set contains basal cover of perennial grasses and canopy cover of shrubs in 122 1m x 1m quadrats on the Jornada Experimental Range in the northern extent of the Chihuahuan Desert of New Mexico, USA. These quadrats were established to investigate livestock grazing effects on plant community dynamics as well as responses to variable climatic conditions over time. Vegetation monitoring is carried out by charting the basal areas of perennial grasses and canopy areas of shrubs within each quadrat. Quadrats were established at different times, with start dates from 1915 to 1932. Specific quadrat locations were selected for a variety of reasons, but the overall intent was to represent varying plant community conditions across the Jornada Experimental Range. From 1915 to 1924 charting was done by dividing the quadrat frame into a decimeter grid using straps and reproducing locations of plants on grid paper. From 1925 to 2016 charting was done using a pantograph. With few exceptions, quadrats were charted until 1947, and a portion of the quadrats were charted intermittently between 1947 and 1979. Sampling resumed again in 1995 and continues every 5-6 years. Charts are digitally scanned, georeferenced, and chart features are digitally reproduced by hand. This data set is not yet complete; charts are actively being processed by Jornada Experimental Range staff and will be updated to this data package as they become available. A companion data package of counts of perennial forbs and subshrubs for each quadrat is also available for this project (data package knb-lter-jrn.210351002). 

### Grasses Grazing

1. Perennial grass recovery following livestock overgazing and shrub removal: an experiment at the Jornada Experimental Range (Jornada Basin LTER), 1996-2016

Havstad, K. and B. Bestelmeyer. 2019. Perennial grass recovery following livestock overgazing and shrub removal: an experiment at the Jornada Experimental Range (Jornada Basin LTER), 1996-2016 ver 17. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/cc0b40f7a34e52b612f384ff0f246e06 (Accessed 2023-03-07).

The objective of this ongoing study is to determine the effect of cattle grazing and shrub removal on the decline and recovery of perennial grasses in a mesquite-invaded black grama grassland on sandy soils in the northern Chihuahuan Desert. The experiment was implemented as a randomized complete block with 3 levels of grazing (summer, winter, and control) and 2 levels of shrub treatment (shrub removal and control) in each of 3 replicate blocks. The 18 experimental units are 0.5 ha (70 x 70 m) exclosures constructed in a mesquite-invaded black grama grassland in the southwest portion of the Jornada Experimental Range in Dona Ana County, New Mexico, USA. Vegetation sampling was conducted with the line-point intercept method. Initial pre-treatment sampling occurred in 1996. Grazing treatments removed 65-80% of aboveground perennial grass biomass over 24-36 hour periods in each of four years from summer 1996 to winter 2000; shrub removal occurred during this time as well. No livestock grazing or shrub removal have occurred since 2000. Post-treatment sampling occurred in 2002, 2009, and 2016.

### Dust 

1. Aeolian dust weights sampled by BSNE collectors in 18 locations at the Jornada Basin LTER site, 1998-ongoing

Okin, G. and D. Gillette. 2022. Aeolian dust weights sampled by BSNE collectors in 18 locations at the Jornada Basin LTER site, 1998-ongoing ver 103. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/6574d6825e7167d7bec234c97973c46d (Accessed 2023-03-07)

This data package contains aeolian dust weights from BSNE collectors at 18 locations at the Jornada Basin LTER. Collections are obtained at the 15 NPP study locations, the Geomet location, Scrape study location (now known as GROWES study), and Pasture 13 Burn study location. The collectors are turned into the wind with wind vanes. The amount of material collected corresponds to the horizontal flux at the height of the collector and the opening area of the collector and the duration of the sampling time. The five heights of the BSNE collectors above the soil surface are 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 centimeters for every location where samples are taken. The vertical flux of the particles smaller than 10 micrometers is assumed to be a constant ratio of the horizontal sand flux. The objectives of the study are to find patterns of sand flux rates as related to soil and vegetation. Site info: The NPP sites were established to estimate patterns of aboveground primary production. The Geomet site is within a mesquite-dune area that has had long-term protection from cattle grazing. The scrape site (now known as the GROWES site) was originally designed to measure the abrasion of surface crust. The Pasture 13 Burn site is located in a pasture that was originally burned in 1998. Contact the data manager for additional information and site locations. This data collection is ongoing with new data added quarterly.

Rabbit survey data on creosotebush and grassland routes from the long-term Small Mammal Exclusion Study at Jornada Basin LTER, 1996-ongoing ver 84. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/a6b4eb557f1ab6cb48f62e6fdd92ae49 (Accessed 2023-03-07).

This data package contains rabbit survey data from grassland and creosote shrubland habitats on Jornada Experimental Range (JER) and Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) lands. Two survey routes were established along Jornada Basin roads in 1996; one in black grama grassland and the other in creosotebush shrubland. Quarterly surveys are conducted on these roads at or near the full moon to measure the density of rabbits in the two vegetation types. Each route is about 6 miles long. Parallel studies were established at the Sevilleta LTER site (New Mexico, USA) and Mapimi Biosphere Reserve (Durango, Mexico). Data collection began in April 1996 and includes date and time lagomorphs are spotted, species identification, habitat type, distance/direction from vehicle, and comments on the weather, moon, and anything unusual. This study is ongoing with new data collected quarterly. 


### Arthropod

1. Arthropod pitfall trap data from 12 NPP study locations at the Jornada Basin LTER site, 1996-2001

This data package contains counts and taxonomic identification of arthropods sampled by pitfall traps at the Jornada Basin LTER site from 1996-2001. The objective of this study is to observe how shifts in vegetation resulting from desertification processes in the Chihuahaun desert have changed the spatial and temporal availability of resources for consumers. Desertification changes in the Jornada Basin include changes from grass to shrub dominated communities and major soil changes. If grassland systems respond to rainfall without significant lags, but shrub systems do not, then consumer species should reflect these differences. In addition, shifts from grassland to shrubland results in greater structural heterogeneity of the habitats. We hypothesized that consumer populations, diversity, and densities of some consumers will be higher in grasslands than in shrublands and will be related to the NPP of the sites. Arthropods were captured in pitfall traps at LTER III consumer plots (a subset of NPP plots) at 2 month intervals. Data collected includes number of individuals, order, family, genus, and species. This study is complete. Earlier arthropod data collected using a different study design are in package knb-lter-jrn.210008002.

Data collected includes number of individuals, order, family, genus, and species. This study is complete. Later arthropod data collected using a different study design are in package knb-lter-jrn.210008001. 

### Cows

1. Criollo and Crossbred Steer Comparison: Weight Gain, Grazing, Carcass Quality, 2015-2017

McIntosh, M., A. Cibils, R. Estell, S. Nyamuryekung'e, S. Spiegal, A. Gonzalez, and A. Blair. 2022. Criollo and Crossbred Steer Comparison: Weight Gain, Grazing, Carcass Quality, 2015-2017 ver 3. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/66ffe320906785bb708c55a61787aa72 (Accessed 2023-03-07).

Rarámuri Criollo cows have behavioral traits that are desirable for rangelands in arid environments, but calves from this biotype are difficult to market through conventional methods. One strategy to improve marketability is to crossbreed these cows with traditional beef breed bulls. However, it is unclear whether crossbred calves will achieve marketable weights and carcass qualities on rangeland and whether they will retain the desirable grazing behaviors of their mothers. We evaluated these traits for two cohorts of Rarámuri Criollo (JRC), Mexican Criollo (MC), and Criollo × beef-breed crossbred (XC) steers. Final live and carcass weights of XC were greater than JRC and MC, but all three groups were market ready at 30-mo after finishing on grass. Carcass quality and average daily gain did not differ among biotypes. Both JRC and XC steers exhibited grazing patterns similar to those previously observed in JRC cows. These results suggest JRC, MC, and XC steers can achieve desirable slaughter weights in 30 months using a rangeland-based grass-fed protocol, and JRC and XC steers retain desirable grazing behaviors of JRC cows.
